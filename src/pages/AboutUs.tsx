            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              At VeriWrite, our mission is to uphold academic integrity by providing educators with 
              powerful tools to detect plagiarism and foster a culture of original thinking. We believe 
              that original work should be recognized and valued, and we're committed to helping educational 
              institutions maintain high standards of academic honesty.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              VeriWrite was founded by a team of educators and technologists who recognized the 
              growing challenge of maintaining academic integrity in the digital age. With the 
              proliferation of online resources, the need for effective plagiarism detection became 
              increasingly critical.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Our founders combined their expertise in education, machine learning, and software 
              development to create a solution that would not only detect similarities in text but 
              also integrate seamlessly with the tools educators already use, such as Google Classroom.
            </p>
